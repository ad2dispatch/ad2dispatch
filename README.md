## Project Status

**Current Stable: v1**</br>
This project is currently being overhauled to support a new SaaS-model.</br>
The `master` branch and all branches from the current `master` (v1) will be deprecated in the future.

## Branch Scheme

- `master` - Stable branch v1
- `master-v1` - Stable branch v1 post-deprecation
- `staging` - Release-candidate v1
- `stable-v2.##.##` - Stable branch v2

When version 2 (SaaS) has reached a sutiable state, the current `master` branch will be moved to `master-v1`.</br>
Post-deprecation of v1, `master` will reflect the most up to date `stable` branch.
